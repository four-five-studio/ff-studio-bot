# FF Studio Bot-Zero

FF Studio bot is an experiment with using LLMs to encourage and support us to do the things we wish we could rememeber. The conceptual idea is it acts as assistant for a specific use case.

It creates a first draft of something so we can hurdle the inertia we find when trying to write and faced with a blank page.

## Things we accept
- (Busy) people can and should use computers to help them with automatable tasks
- What people do with their time is a wider political issue this project is not exploring
- That these tools were brought into existence treating copy right laws unappropriately
- We want to support a new copyright / lisencing model that equitably gives value back to copy-right owners

## Things we dont know yet and want to learn
- is the outcome is worth the carbon costs relating to CPU/GPU usage?
- the outcome is worth accepting the political costs of how the LLM traning data sets were aquiried?
- are people able to meaningfully consent to using this, do they have a meaninful alternative?
- what social norms are encouraged, perverted, and which ones do we want to encourage
- what user experiences make this playful, useful and enable meaningful consent
- what languages and phrases do we need to explain it?
- what technical choices balance climate costs, usability and privacy.

We are using this work to learn, and feel our way forward.
